            <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
            <p>I'm a Full Stack Web Developer/WebApp Penetration Tester. I first started coding about a year ago. After switching to Linux about six years ago, and using bash, the next logical step was to start learning some other languages. Python was the
                first language I set out to learn. I had known bash for a while, but not well enough to script with it. My introduction to Python lit a fire in me, and that's when I realized that this is what I needed to do.</p>
            <p>While learning Python, one of my first attempts at a console app was a random password generator. This natural led me to wanting to store my passwords. That's when I starting with SQL(MySQL/SQLite3, specifically). About 9 months later, I applied
                for Lambda School, and that is how I arrived here.</p>
